As mentioned in one of my previous posts, the automotive industry has started to take advantage of Silverlight. The most recent release is the <a href=" http://www.kbb.com/pcfphoto" target="_blank">Perfect Car Finder - Photo Edition from Kelley Blue Book</a>. This has been written in Silverlight 1 and utilises DeepZoom technology.

Renault have also taken advantage of DeepZoom with their new <a href="http://www.laguna-coupe.com/silverlight" target="_blank">Laguna Coupe mini site.</a> This site was written using Silverlight 2 and demonstrates the high quality video Silverlight can offer.

BMW Germany was one of the first manufacturers that I know of to use Silverlight on a public facing website. <a title="http://www.silverlight.bmw-tv.de.axprod.net/frontend/app/Default.html" href="http://www.silverlight.bmw-tv.de.axprod.net/frontend/app/Default.html">http://www.silverlight.bmw-tv.de.axprod.net/frontend/app/Default.html</a>

Aston Martin showed off their use of Silverlight and WPF at Mix 08 earlier this year.

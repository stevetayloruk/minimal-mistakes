This book has quality in every direction, from the physical finish and type of paper used to the great authoring style. The book is very well presented with great illustrations and examples.

It starts off by demystifying the true meaning of what an Information Dashboard is and then goes into what I thought was the best chapter of the book â€“ Tapping into the power of visual perception. This chapter was really interesting especially for me coming from a design background. It goes into the science of visual perception, the pre-attentive mind and short term memory.

When you read this book you need to bear in mind the context in which you operate. This book pushes home the communication factor of dashboards which may not be as important in your situation.

All in all this is a "must read" book for anyone who creates and designs information dashboards.

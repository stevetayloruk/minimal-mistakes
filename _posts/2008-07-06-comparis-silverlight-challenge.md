In April, Microsoft Switzerland created a <a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/swiss_dpe_team/archive/2008/04/17/silverlight-2-beta-1-end-to-end-hands-on-lab.aspx" target="_blank">Silverlight 2 Beta 1 hands-on lab</a>, the lab was created to support the <a href="http://www.silverlightchallenge.ch/" target="_blank">Comparis Silverlight Challenge</a>. The challenge came to an end on 22nd June 2008.&nbsp; The winner was Styv Mermod from Yverdon-les-Bains and here are some screen shots of the entry.

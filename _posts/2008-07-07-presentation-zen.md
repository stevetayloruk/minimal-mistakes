I've bought a new book today. Presentation Zen: Simple Ideas on Presentation Design and Delivery (<a href="http://www.amazon.co.uk/Presentation-Zen-Simple-Design-Delivery/dp/0321525655/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&amp;s=books&amp;qid=1215449586&amp;sr=8-1" target="_blank">Amazon Link</a>). 

From time to time I find myself having to present a concept or idea to a group of people and every time I tend to reinvent the wheel when it comes to writing the presentation. I've recently stumbled across this guy, Garr Reynolds, and his <a href="http://www.presentationzen.com" target="_blank">website</a>. He is also on You Tube, check out the video below.

Anyway, I'll let you know how good the book is once I've read it.

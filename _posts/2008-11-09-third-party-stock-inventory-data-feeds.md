<p>All dealers know that the the bigger the forecourt and the more stock on show the more chance a sale will be made.&#160; With the internet now being an everyday tool for the consumer to research their purchase before they buy most dealers have embraced the web with their very own website.&#160; The problem lies with the brand.&#160; The big portals and magazines/newspapers have great marketing budgets and have become the first point of call for most users.&#160; The question is: What’s the best way to accommodate the plethora of portals, all using their own schemas and their different delivery channels?&#160; This also becomes more difficult across multiple dealers and dealer groups.</p>  <p>The portal sites vary on their business model also.&#160; Some based on a per vehicle basis and some on a per lead basis.</p>  <p>The main portal that almost everyone advertises with is <a target="_blank" href="http://www.autotrader.co.uk">Auto Trader</a>.&#160; Auto Trader works on a cost per vehicle advertised per week.&#160; At the time of writing I believe this to be around the £4 mark, being discounted based on number of vehicles and manufacturer deals to as low as around £2.</p>  <p><a target="_blank" href="http://www.netcars.co.uk/">netcars</a> on the other hand charge on a per lead basis.&#160; They provide the dealership with a free Non-Geographic Number (NGN), normally a local 0845 number.&#160; This allows them to track the enquiries.&#160; The price at the time of writing is £5 per lead.</p>  <p><a target="_blank" href="http://www.skupe.net">Skupe.net</a> on the other hand have a different variation to that of netcars.&#160; By default there listings are free, but if you want to have a sponsored listing you appear at the top of the search results (like Google) and pay for the lead.&#160; Depending on the lead you get, being a call (£10), email(£5) or click thru (£0.35).</p>

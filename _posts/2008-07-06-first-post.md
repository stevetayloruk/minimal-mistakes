Well, this is sort of my first post. It's my third attempt at blogging. The other two blogs fell by the wayside pretty quickly. So what makes this attempt so different?? Well, nothing really, except Im older, wiser and probably have more things to talk about and share. 

So what can you expect from this blog? Well, you can expect a little from the following: 

 - Development Stuff - source code, design, techniques etc.
 - Technology - software, hardware, gadgets etc.
 - Automotive - technology, solutions, industry news, opinions etc.
 - Miscellaneous - book reviews, comments, business etc.

Really a bit of everything. Enjoy...

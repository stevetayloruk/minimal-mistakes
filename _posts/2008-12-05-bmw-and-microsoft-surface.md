Vectorform have developed another Microsoft Surface application for BMW. They started off with a prototype for a X6 configurator.

The prototype was such a success that they followed up with a much improved version for the 7 series that allow the user to fully customise the vehicle through the Natural User Interface(NUI). 360Â° views of the interior and exterior of the car, along with the ability to change and view the paint and trim immerses the user in a fully interactive environment.

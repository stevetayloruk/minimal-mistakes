This book covers all aspects of data warehousing and gives examples along with downloadable source&nbsp;code&nbsp;for Microsoft SQL Server 2005/08. The book goes into quite a bit of detail in certain areas but in others it just skims the surface.&nbsp; It's a great book to get someone started off in data warehousing as it covers the main aspects well. 

That said, once you've read this book you may also want to go on and look at specific areas in more detail, such as Reporting Services (SSRS), Integration Services (SSIS), Business Intelligence (BI) and Analysis Services (SSAS).


My only complaint with is book (if you can call it that), is that the author tends to repeat himself and state the obvious quite a lot. This is probably to help the information sink in and probably aimed more towards the novice.

## Overview ##

**Pros:** Covers all aspects well, scenario based theme with examples 
**Cons:** Too many words to describe the facts, enterprise view only, no smaller project examples 
**Rating:** 4/5 
**Verdict:** Recommended for anyone looking to build a DW and haven&rsquo;t done so before.

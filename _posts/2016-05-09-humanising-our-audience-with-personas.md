Personas are essentially fictional characters that represent the different user types that use our website. I'm not a huge fan of personas as they are one-dimensional and can be misleading, for example, our first persona represents a Developer but our 'Creator' group could also be a designer for example. With that said, they do a good job of humanising our audience and communicating the types of user we need to cater for, which can help keep the user in mind when designing the site.

The personas below are 'typical' users for our website that stem from the research we did in the [first post][1]. To help with the personas I used <a href="http://www.uifaces.com" target="_blank">uifaces</a> and <a href="http://uinames.com" target="_blank">uinames</a>.


## Vincent Martinez - Creator ##

## Summary & Next Steps ##
I've seen personas with tons of information such as bios, income, marital status etc. but for most occasions this information is not relevant and only adds noise. We'll revisit the personas when we come to do the user journeys, but first we need to establish our user's requirements, which is the focus of the next post.
